1. First we had to check the network topology to see which addresses to set up and what names were assigned to each. For instance, 192.168.0.4 is a host address but 10.0.0.3 is a router address. Once this was in place, the default routing made sure that all the hosts could communicate with the router and the per-destination routes were similar enough that they fell into place easily. 

2. As with the previous projects, there are no known errors at this time.

3. Keeping track of the correct ip address numbers was a little stressful. If one accidentally switches between 198 and 192, the routes will not go through. As well, some ports may have been in use that needed to be opened before the AS352.py project could be rerun. 

4. Setting up a network has some intersectionality with graph theory and topology.
